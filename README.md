"Bonjour, I'm [Your Name], a French lycée student with a passion for low-level programming and embedded systems. Although I have experience with high-level programming languages, I'm drawn to the intricacies of low-level development. In my free time, I enjoy learning and experimenting with new technologies, from building websites to exploring the world of embedded systems. Self-taught and always eager to learn, I'm excited to share my projects and collaborate with others on GitHub."
